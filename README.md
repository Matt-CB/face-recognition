**Facenet512** is a face recognition model that uses an Inception ResNet architecture. It is pretrained on the VGGFace2 dataset and provides a 512-dimensional embedding for each face. This model is known for its high accuracy in face recognition tasks and is often used for tasks such as face verification and clustering

**YuNet** is a lightweight, fast, and accurate face detection model developed by OpenCV. It achieves high performance on the WIDER Face validation set, with scores of 0.834 (AP_easy), 0.824 (AP_medium), and 0.708 (AP_hard). YuNet is designed to detect faces with sizes ranging from 10x10 to 300x300 pixels. It is optimized for real-time applications and can be used with OpenCVâ€™s DNN module.
